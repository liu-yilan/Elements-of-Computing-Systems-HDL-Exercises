# Elements-of-Computing-Systems-HDL-Exercises

This repository contains the solutions for all the HDL (Hardware Description Language) exercises in Chapters 1-6 in "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. The documentation for the HDL used can be found in the book. You can load the code I've written into the hardware simultaor IDE created by the authors: https://nand2tetris.github.io/web-ide/chip/. 

The exercises begin by building simple logic gates (And, Not, Multiplexer, etc.) from Nand gates before progressing to more complex gates like an Arithmetic Logic Unit, Register, Program Counter, CPU, and finally, a Computer.
